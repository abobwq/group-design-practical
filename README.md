## TODO
### Preprocessing
1. Take log of features of very varying scale (to avoid the situation that most companies after normalising have non-distinctive features)
2. For SID columns, take only SIC1 (those are the first two digits of nSIC, which matters the most)
3. Use only one of oac columns, get rid of the others
